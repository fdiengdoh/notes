# Pretty Url with PHP

A set of classes for making pretty url from php.

## What is this exactly?

Well for now it is just something for me to play around with the process of making packages available through composer. Maybe one day it would be useful to others

## Here I am releasing the v0.1.0 version.

Hope it works

### Install using composer as follows:

```composer require fdiengdoh/purl:dev-main
